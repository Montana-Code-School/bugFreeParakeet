Underwater story

Once upon a time there was an octopus by the name of Ted. Ted lived by himself, off of a beautiful reef, in a small cavity, which had formed when an old wooden ship had smashed into the reef. For the most part Ted was happy, he had many friends, a great house, in a great area, and food was plentiful and easy to obtain. The day to day routine at the reef was almost never changed, except for the occasional disruption of a storm. It was on one of these normal, non-extraordinary days that something suddenly changed, a shadow fell upon the area. When Ted noticed that it had become dark out, he thought to himself how odd it was, he swore there were no storms predicted that day. Ted then emerged from his hollow to see what was going on. Ted looked up towards the sky. That's when he saw it: a small, brightly colored boat had appeared. Ted and the other inhabitants of the reef had never seen a boat, besides the sunken ship that most of them called home. Suddenly, there was a splash next to the boat! Ted and the other sea life watched as the bubbles cleared …..

Option 1: It’s a monster!
	What they saw was gigantic! And ugly! It must be some kind of monster! It moved slowly and awkwardly towards the ship. The fish scattered, bumping into each other and the ship, as they ran. Except Ted, Ted couldn’t move. The sight of the massive creature was overwhelming! Ted…..

	Option 1.1: Stared, unblinking..
Ted couldn’t help it and he certainly couldn’t stop! He was just so curious about the human. As the human approached Ted…..
	Option 1.2: Started to shake uncontrollably..
Ted was scared! So very, very scared! Ted tried to crawl back to his hollow but the shaking prevented him from moving quickly…..

Option 2: Grandpa speaks up.
	Suddenly the silence was broken, startling the group. “Humph!” It was the oldest inhabitant of the reef, Bubbles. “It’s a human!” Bubbles grumbled, “they smell funny and poke you with their stubby fins while flashing lights at you! Stay away from them!” At that point old Bubbles swam away, a group of the younger fish on his heels, asking him questions about the human. That's when Ted had an idea……

	Option 2.1: He would greet the human!
How else do you make friends but to introduce yourself?!? How bad could this human be? Ted decided he pick some of the local fauna as a welcome gift to present to the human...
	Option 2.2: He was form an attack party!
Ted was filled with rage! He would not let this THING come into neighborhood and poke at his friends! Ted turned to his companions and cleared his throat…...
